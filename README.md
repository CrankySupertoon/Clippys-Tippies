# Clippy's Tippies
### Because someone asked for it.

A simple mod to add tips to loading screens.

Tips are located under `.minecraft/resources/tippy/tips`, in JSON files. In order to add tips, create a new JSON there with whichever name you prefer, and fill the structure, which is:

```json
[ 
  { "text": "Tip A" }, 
  { "text": "Tip B" }, 
  { "text": "Tip C" }
 ]
```
